build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to
change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar,
Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with
us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are
the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse
and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come
to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays).

### **About The Role:**

Remember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and
excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that
experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful
tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of
computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present,
but we need your engineering to pull it off.

### **What You'll Do:**

  * You'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build a tool that allows admins to manage all their workspaces at once.
  * You'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might optimize our block data model.
  * You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include building dashboards and alerting to ensure that our features are reliable.

### **What We're Looking For:**

  * **Thoughtful problem-solving:** For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
  * **Shipping quality user interfaces:** You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
  * **Familiarity with the backend:** You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.
  * **Pragmatic and business-oriented:** You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
  * **Put users first:** You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
  * **Not ideological about technology:** To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
  * **Empathetic communication:** You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
  * **Team player:** You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.

### **Bonus Points:**

  * You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
  * You have prior experience working on Enterprise systems: SAML, SCIM, eDiscovery, Access control mechanisms like RBAC, and more.
  * You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
  * You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

minware provides engineering business metrics that show the true cost of
engineering impediments. This helps organizations make better decisions with
stronger alignment between engineers and executives.

Kevin Borders founded minware after bootstrapping his previous company to $86m
in revenue and selling in 2021, with the idea of helping others benefit from
lessons learned growing an engineering team from 0 to 40.

minware is a self-funded seed-stage company. After promising initial customer
traction, we are looking for people who share our values to help bring minware
to a larger audience.

## **The Role**

As an early engineer, you will have the unique opportunity to work directly
with minware's founders to build the product from the ground up. We are
looking for someone who enjoys designing, developing, and maintaining front-
end software.

We are seeking an ambitious and nice engineer who has experience independently
executing complex projects and building scalable, maintainable software. As a
purveyor of developer productivity analytics, we are diligent about process
efficiency and code quality. Though we are small, we try to avoid
unnecessarily creating technical debt and are looking for someone who can lead
us toward this goal.

## **Primary Responsibilities**

  * Develop UX/UX components for customer facing applications to enhance scalability, performance, and user experience
  * Work closely with product managers and customers to define minware's capabilities
  * Perform code reviews, unit testing, and continuous integration to maintain code quality standards

38,"Software Engineer, Customer Studio Backend",Hightouch,"## **About Hightouch**

Hightouch's mission is to empower everyone to take action on their data.
Through our Reverse ETL platform, business and data users can seamlessly sync
data from where it resides, such as warehouses and databases, to where it is
needed, including operational systems and SaaS tools. Traditionally, acting on
data has required engineering time and bandwidth, and left most business users
stuck with charts and reports that are unable to take automated action on
their data. With Hightouch, every business user, without writing any code, can
activate data to streamline critical processes, improve marketing performance,
and scale operations.

Our team operates with a focus on making a meaningful impact for our
customers. We believe in approaching challenges with a first principles
thinking mindset, moving quickly and embracing our value of efficient
execution, and treating each other with compassion and kindness. We look for
team members that are strong communicators, have a growth mindset, and are
motivated and persistent in achieving our goals.

Hundreds of companies use Hightouch, including Spotify, Ramp, Retool, NBA,
Plaid, and Betterment. We're based in San Francisco, are remote-friendly, and
backed by leading investors such as Amplify Partners, ICONIQ Growth, Bain
Capital Ventures, Y-Combinator, and Afore Capital.

## **About the Role**

Building upon Reverse ETL's ability to use SQL to sync to any SaaS tool,
Customer Studio is Hightouch's second major product that provides a purpose-
built no-code suite of features that enables anyone, regardless of their SQL
experience, to activate data directly from their warehouse. Despite being a
small team (3 engineers, 1 PM, 1 designer), Customer Studio is our fastest
growing product and already accounts for nearly half of our revenue, which
also gives this role the potential to have significant impact!

We're looking to add a **product-minded backend engineer** to the team. The
ideal candidate will be comfortable diving deep into backend and distributed
systems and think holistically about architecture, scalability,
maintainability, and reliability. We also are looking for someone with strong
customer and product thinking and who feels comfortable writing and engaging
with product specs.

Some of the problems we'll be working on include:

  * **Data Warehouse Performance:** We're consistently pushing the limits of what data warehouses can handle in terms of speed, performance, and interactivity. We explore optimizations generally (e.g. optimizing queries, storing pre-computed state), as well as investigate warehouse-specific improvements.
  * **Analytics and Experimentation:** How can Hightouch help customers build segments and decide what data they want to sync? How can we facilitate experimentation to downstream tools, including tracking the performance of different audiences?
  * **Real-time Audience Syncing:** Our users are always interested in faster syncing and fresher data. As warehouses become more real-time and adopt technologies like CDC, we're excited to explore real-time audience computation and syncing.
  * **Generative AI:** We're continuously working on making the user experience of acting on data more seamless, and are optimistic generative AI can enhance user workflows.

We are looking for talented, intellectually curious, and motivated individuals
who are interested in tackling the problems above. This is a senior role, but
we focus on impact and potential for growth more than years of experience. The
salary range for this position is $170,000 - $240,000 USD per year, which is
location independent in accordance with our remote-first policy.

## **Interview Process**

Our interview process focuses on evaluating fit for the most important
dimensions of the role: product sense, ability to architect backend and
distributed systems, and alignment with Hightouch's values. Notably, we don't
do any programming interviews as we believe they are low signal to noise and
aren't a good evaluation mechanism.

  * **Intro Call [15-30m]** : Introductory call with either a member of our recruiting team or the hiring manager to get to know each other and see if the role could be a good mutual fit.

  * **Product Sense Interview [60m]** : Coming up with potential product and feature ideas in response to customer requirements. Focuses primarily on product solutioning with some technical analysis in determining the feasibility of ideas.
  * **System Design Interview [90m]** : Work with the interviewer to architect a system at a conceptual level. The problem will be at a pretty high level - and have both product and customer requirements as well as technical.

Hadrian is building autonomous factories that help aerospace and defense
companies make rockets, jets, and satellites 10x faster and 2x cheaper. Our
CEO, Chris Power, discusses the importance of what we're building in this
video.

  
We are a lean but mighty team of 80 (and growing!) people that are passionate
about building critical infrastructure to support the nation and the
advancement of humanity.  

  

To support our ambitious vision, we have raised > $100M from **Lux Capital,
A16Z, Founders Fund, Construct Capital, Caffeinated Capital, and more**.

**  
Building Flow**

As a foundational member of our software engineering team, you'll work closely
with our product, operations, data, and robotics teams to make **Flow** , our
FactoryOS, the factory platform of the future.

**  
Flow** is composed of a variety of internal and external critical business
applications. Internally, we build software that informs, augments, and
replaces work that needs to be done in the factory — for example, taking a
customer request for parts, analyzing the complexity and cost, load balancing
the work based on factory capacity, and returning a dynamic price quote and
delivery estimate. Externally, our software helps our customers interface with
Hadrian and manage their supply chain in real time.  

  

_Note: you do not need to have aerospace, defense, or manufacturing experience
to excel in this role_

### **In this role you will:**

  * Scope, architect, implement, and deploy critical applications that will drive revenue and make a positive impact in the world
  * Support frontend application development across multiple product verticals
  * Work directly with our internal and external customers to drive our roadmap
  * Get to build alongside an incredible team of engineers, operators, and the best machinists/CAM programmers in the world
  * Be given autonomy and virtually unlimited room to grow

### **This might be a good fit if you:**

  * Have extensive experience shipping modern, performant, front-ends, preferably in React/Typescript

  * Bias to action, take pride in your work, and care more about getting to the right solution than being right
  * Have tech-lead critical projects or initiatives
  * Have worked on large, complex codebases
  * Are product-minded and user-obsessed
  * Are just as comfortable implementing pixel perfect UIs as you are whipping up prototypes without design support (and pragmatic enough to know when to take each approach)
  * Are excited to work in a fast-paced environment with high-stakes and quick iteration cycles
  * Are a previous or future founder — if you leave Hadrian to start a company we'll do everything to support you, including investing in you and introducing you to Hadrian's investors
  * Can work from our Los Angeles Factory (Torrance)

**Compensation and Benefits**

  
For this role, the target salary range is $150,000 - $275,000 (actual range
may vary based on experience).

  
This is the lowest to highest salary we reasonably and in good faith believe
we would pay for this role at the time of this posting. We may ultimately pay
more or less than the posted range, and the range may be modified in the

challenges: engaging patients from a distance, working across disciplines,
sharing information, making handoffs, tracking the impact of care management

As more is demanded of care teams, the software tools they've relied upon come
up short and fail. Inflexible software leads to frustrated teams. Frustration
affects performance, which increases costs and threatens organizational

help lead us forward. If you’re ready to challenge your limits and build your
future, join us.

Who You'll Work With:

We are seeking a _Mid Level Data Engineer_ based _in Nashville_ to join our
_MAS Technology department_ in Global Technology & Operations

The Multi-Asset Technology group supports quantitative research, model
development, and portfolio management processes for Multi-Asset Solutions
(MAS) unit of AB. Specifically, we directly support the Dynamic Asset
Allocation (DAA) group, the Outcome-Oriented Product group, the Defined-
Contribution Retirement Solutions group, the Custom Alternative Solutions
group, the Index and Factor Investment group, and other quantitative
investment groups.

What You'll Do:

The Risk Data Engineer is a key role for our firm providing data pipelines and
data quality control between our internal data warehouse and investment
reporting platform and an external investment risk engine.

Applications and business or enterprise functions the role supports

MAS actively manages over $100 billion for global institutions, high net worth
individuals and retail mutual fund investors. The group’s macro and
quantitative research insights are used to develop innovative investment
products and drive investment decisions. We assess both short and long-term
outlooks for risk and return across all major markets, including Equities,
Fixed Income, Currencies, Commodities, Credit, Real Assets, and Alternatives.
We use quantitative and fundamental research techniques that are highly
adaptive to the current market environment. We combine these views with the
specific needs of clients to develop custom portfolio solutions.

Over the past couple of years, MAS has grown rapidly and continues to add new
sources of market data, new security instruments, and new quantitative tools
to its investment and research process. The diversity and complexity of the
investment types requires a robust data acquisition, mapping and quality
control process between our internal systems and an external risk analytics
engine.

  * Develop and enhance our investment risk platform interfaces. Perform code and design reviews ensuring adherence to architecture principles, while meeting business use case requirements. Collaborate with an offshore development and data oversight team to execute integration and regression tests prior to code release. 

  * Develop data quality tests and related reports to identify interface failures and/or risk and performance data anomalies. Build workflow automation tools to recalculate daily or historical risk / performance numbers once problem input data has been remediated. 

  * Manage vendor and / or upstream application functional defects and / or operational outages/incidents, ensuring timely recovery / issue resolution accompanied by a thorough root cause analysis. 

  * Develop a new portfolio risk and performance reporting platform which aggregates security level risk exposures from the external risk engine and returns from our internal performance engine. 

_(if applicable)_?

Risk and performance data is perhaps the most challenging data domain in any
financial industry database in that it requires the accuracy of all data which
can impact an investment’s future cash flow. This project will expose the
candidate to the entire investment lifecycle including initial client account
set up / new product launch, initial market valuation and risk calculation,
ongoing risk and performance monitoring, until final investment maturity or
liquidation.

professional growth does the role offer the candidate?)_

The candidate will have an opportunity to learn or leverage existing skills in
SQL, Python, distributed storage and execution platforms, statistical process
control, and DataOps methodologies.

The candidate will work closely with professional investment staff and get an
opportunity to broaden their financial knowledge across asset classes, markets
and instruments

What We're Looking For:

  * Degree in Computer Science/Engineering, Master’s degree preferred 

  * 5+ years experience as a developer involved in enterprise data integration, ideally in the finance industry 

  * 5+ years experience programming SQL queries and stored procedures (Microsoft SQL Server or ORACLE) 

  * 3+ years experience in Python 

  * 2+ years experience using Agile or DevOps methodologies (continuous integration / deployment) 

Skills

  * Strong project management, analytical and quantitative skills 

  * This is a data-centric development role. The candidate must be willing to learn the problem domain; namely, the investment / trade lifecycle, financial instruments and the terms and conditions that impact risk and return. 

  * Candidate must be willing to take full ownership of projects, covering analysis, technical design and implementation, testing, and deployment tasks 

  * Software engineering skills including object-oriented design, application of design patterns 

  * Must demonstrate good communication skills and be comfortable working closely with senior quantitative analysts and business partners 

  * A strong desire to document and share work done to aid in long term support 

  * Candidate must be a self-starter, a dependable partner, and team player 

Special Knowledge _(if applicable)_

  * Knowledge of financial instruments 

  * Experience with Git/GitHub 

  * Experience with risk platform or market data vendors - MSCI, BarraOne, Bloomberg, Refinitive et. al. 

  * Experience working in the finance industry, demonstrable curiosity in quantitative research and investment 

  * Workflow orchestration tools such as Airflow, Control-M, Autosys 

  * Business intelligence tools such as PowerBI

148,Staff Data Engineer,Linktree,"**The Role**

Linktree’s Data Platform team is at the forefront of transforming the way
Linktree leverages data, working closely with the insights, analytics
engineering, product and marketing teams to become truly data driven.

  
As a Staff Data Engineer at Linktree, you will be the driving force behind
scaling how data is consumed at Linktree. Not only will you be modeling some
of our most important data sets to gain insights, such as the data that helps
us understand the driving factors behind the success of our product or our
revenue, we take self-service one step further. You will also build the
platform that can be used by Data Analysts, Marketers, Engineers and anyone
else who is interested to model their own data to fit their specific needs and
not be dependent on a data team.

  
This is your opportunity to make an impact at Linktree and push the boundaries
of what is possible with data self-service!

**Location Expectations:** Hybrid. We're growing our team in LA and the Bay
Area, and plan to have offices in both locations. We expect team members to
come into their respective office 2x/week.

**What You Will Do**

  * Develop and implement the strategy for the Data Platform in close collaboration with other data and engineering leaders. 

  * Continue leading the transformation to make data a first-class citizen in software development at Linktree. This includes providing other teams with the self-service capabilities to ingest, transform, consume and integrate data with other systems for both production and analytics use-cases. 

  * You will be building and improving data-driven systems including, but not limited to, instrumentation at the source, event ingestion, event brokers, data warehouses, pipelines and integration systems used to activate data in third parties, such as an experimentation platform, product analytics and marketing tooling. 

  * Ensure our data platform continues to scale with our rapidly growing user base and ever-evolving product. Linktree’s growth constantly creates new challenges like needing to master data governance and discoverability with many different teams producing data, or hitting the scalability limits of cloud providers. 

**  
What We Are Looking For**

  * A platform mindset. Our Data Platform team does not do repetitive data transformation and integration jobs for others. The team builds the infrastructure and tools that allows Linktree to perform these tasks at scale by enabling all teams to perform data-related jobs themselves. 

  * Data as well as a software engineering background. Our data platform spans from the SDKs that our teams use to emit and consume data in front- and back-end applications to the integration with various third-party systems, including everything in between (data ingestion, event brokers, data persistence, etc.). To be successful in your role you’ll need to be proficient in both. Having worked with distributed, event-driven systems is a plus. 

  * Experience operating at scale. You have worked on data systems that power a product that serves hundreds of millions of active users. 

_Linktree is committed to providing a competitive compensation package. Our
cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $175,000-$225,000 in the
San Francisco Bay or Los Angeles area. Final offer amounts are determined by
multiple factors including candidate expertise, the scope of role and level,
and may vary from the amounts listed above._

all actively encouraged to appear on our Zoom screens. All of us at Linktree
work either fully remote or a hybrid ""remote, but in-office sometimes""
approach.

We currently have offices in Melbourne, Sydney and LA, but our team is spread
across Australia, United States, and New Zealand. As our team approaches 200
people, our company will be 10x the size we were in 2020.

We offer autonomy and flexibility in how you structure your days and weeks.
There will be the need for some collaboration outside of a ""normal"" 9-5 being
a global company, but we aim to work asynchronously where possible.

**Our Culture and Benefits**

Linktree's company culture and values are based around collaboration,
diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give
you some more specific examples:

  * We recognize that our team are individually unique and have designed our benefits with this in mind. Each person has an annual allowance to use on things like (but not limited to) fitness memberships, development courses, childcare, travel, charitable donations, pet insurance, home office set up - the choice is yours!

195,Staff Data Engineer,Linktree,"**The Role**

  
Linktree’s Data Engineering team is at the forefront of transforming the way
Linktree leverages data, working closely with the insights, data platform
product and marketing teams to become truly data driven.

  
As a Staff Data Engineer at Linktree, you will be the driving force behind
scaling how data is consumed at Linktree. Not only will you be modelling some
of our most important data sets to gain insights, such as the data that helps
us understand the driving factors behind the success of our product or our
revenue, we take self-service one step further. You will also build the
platform that can be used by Data Analysts, Marketers, Engineers and anyone
else who is interested to model their own data to fit their specific needs and
not be dependent on a data team.

  
This is your opportunity to make an impact at Linktree and push the boundaries
of what is possible with data self-service!

**Location Expectations:** Hybrid. We're growing our team in LA and the Bay
Area, and plan to have offices in both locations. We expect team members to
come into their respective office 2x/week.

**What You Will Do**

  * Build the platform that allows data analysts, product managers, marketers and other heavy data users to model their own data as well as making that data available in tools of their choosing, such as product analytics tools, BI tools, an experimentation platform or our CRM system.
  * Continue leading the transformation to make data a first-class citizen in software development at Linktree. This includes defining standards and providing guidance to product teams who emit the vast majority of our data.
  * Build and maintaining robust, efficient and integrated data models. We don’t believe that Analytics Engineers should be painfully cleaning up after others and deal with bad data all day long, if you are faced with a “garbage in, garbage out” situation, you will work with the engineers in our product teams to come up with a better way to emit the raw data.
  * You will also provide support to other data users including peer-reviews, training and acting as a data modeling/SQL/dbt SME across various business initiatives.

**What We Are Looking For**

  * A platform mindset. Data teams main focus is not to do repetitive data transformation and integration jobs for others. The team builds the infrastructure and tools that allows Linktree to perform these tasks at scale by enabling all teams to perform data-related jobs themselves.
  * You understand data-driven product development and have experience with the typical tools used by high-performing product teams, such product analytics, experimentation, but also general purpose BI tools.
  * Experience in data modeling with the ability to translate business requirements to fit for purpose data products for critical use-cases (reporting to the board, understanding key drivers of product success).
  * Experience operating at scale. You have worked on data systems that power a product that serves hundreds of millions of active users.
  * Proficient in SQL and experience with working on cloud-based warehouses (experience in Snowflake is a bonus), as well as working with DBT.

  
Linktree is committed to providing a competitive compensation package. Our
cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $175,000-$225,000 in the
San Francisco Bay or Los Angeles area. Final offer amounts are determined by
multiple factors including candidate expertise, the scope of role and level,
and may vary from the amounts listed above.

P.S. If you don’t tick every box in this ad, please don’t rule yourself out.

**Where and How We Work**

We are a global and diverse group offering a truly flexible and family
friendly work environment. Kids, pets, and the occasional delivery person are
all actively encouraged to appear on our Zoom screens. All of us at Linktree
work either fully remote or a hybrid ""remote, but in-office sometimes""
approach.

We currently have offices in Melbourne, Sydney and LA, but our team is spread
across Australia, United States, and New Zealand. As our team approaches 200
people, our company will be 10x the size we were in 2020.

We offer autonomy and flexibility in how you structure your days and weeks.
There will be the need for some collaboration outside of a ""normal"" 9-5 being
a global company, but we aim to work asynchronously where possible.

**Our Culture and Benefits**

Linktree's company culture and values are based around collaboration,
diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give
you some more specific examples:

  * We recognize that our team are individually unique and have designed our benefits with this in mind. Each person has an annual allowance to use on things like (but not limited to) fitness memberships, development courses, childcare, travel, charitable donations, pet insurance, home office set up - the choice is yours!
  * We provide top-flight medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance - we cover 100% of your monthly premiums (and 80% for your dependents).
  * 401k matching up to 6%.
  * Employee Stock Option Program - we want each and every employee to share in the company’s success as we go further together.
  * To learn more about our benefits, including our parental leave program, volunteering leave, DE&I initiatives, and more, !

**  
Who We Are.** The ﬁrst of its kind in the nation, the San Francisco Commission
on the Status of Women was established in 1975 by the Board of Supervisors
after years of advocacy on the part of the San Francisco women’s community. In
1994, the voters of San Francisco approved Proposition E, which created a
permanent City Department on the Status of Women to carry out the policies of
the Commission.

  * All references to “women and girls” include gender-expansive individuals and any woman or girl identiﬁed individual.

Today, the Commission and the Department’s primary purpose is to ensure women
and girls equal economic, social, political and educational opportunities
within City and County government through policies, legislation and programs.

Each year, the Department’s grants program distributes funds to community-
based nonproﬁt organizations that provide essential programs and services to
over 20,000 individuals annually. In 2021, as part of a strategic shift to
create a greater impact and serve more San Franciscans, while building a more
diverse and eﬃcient city government through gender-responsive, racially
equitable policies and programs, the Department identiﬁed three core service
areas to catalyze transformative change in the lives of women, girls, and
gender nonbinary people: (1) Health and Safety; (2) Economic Security; and (3)
Civic Engagement and Political Empowerment.

Through these areas, the Department aims to improve the whole lives of our
targeted communities, including their health, wealth, physical safety, and
well-being. Our programming is designed to not just create balance when it
comes to the construct of gender, but also to empower women, girls, and gender
nonbinary people with the tools and resources to build pathways to healthy,
safe and prosperous futures.

Working at the intersection of health, safety, socioeconomics, politics and
gender, the Department on the Status of Women (DOSW) is looking for a smart,
self-motivated, heart-centered individual to join us as we continue our
mission of equipping women, girls and gender nonbinary people with the
education, tools and resources they need to thrive(!) and create opportunities
and pathways to success.

DOSW endeavors to advance bold ideas and policy solutions that help women,
girls and nonbinary people close inequality gaps, improve their social
standing and well-being, build political power and inﬂuence and create
economic stability, security and mobility.

We know that when it comes to building a knowledge- and evidence-based policy
agenda grounded in cohesive research, data is Queen. And bad data in leads to
wrong outcomes coming out. Beginning this year, the Department is investing in
procuring information-technology solutions to create greater accuracy in our
data and reporting, eﬃciency in our operations, as well as increased
accountability and management of precious public dollars. We believe that
technological solutions are intended to help streamline workﬂows, reduce
errors, and decrease time spent manually processing ﬁscal and programmatic
data.

DOSW is immediately hiring for a Research, Data and Evaluation Analyst to
continue the work of building out and leading our research, data and
evaluation systems, programs and agenda and position DOSW as the go-to
municipal knowledge broker on gender equity and the human rights of women and
girls. Additionally, this position will also coordinate the development and
implementation of a community needs assessment and manage Envisio, DOSW’s new
data management portal.

set, or creating a model to identify high potential accounts, you'll
absolutely be having impact on the direction of the business.

  * You'll partner with Revenue Operations, Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas
  * Synthesize insights into crisp narratives and present to senior leadership, and drive and verify change in our business processes. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
  * You'll build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for making key decisions, and self-service tools and reports to enable business partners
  * You'll build models that are core to the operation of the business, such as revenue forecasting or identifying high-value accounts for more hands-on support
  * Partner closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines

### **Skills You'll Need to Bring:**

  * You've spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with Revenue Operations, Sales, Customer Success, Business Operations, and / or Finance related functions

  * You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)

  * You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
  * Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments

441,"Research Scientist, Machine Learning / AI",Basis,"#### **About Basis**

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization
with two mutually reinforcing goals.

The first is to **understand and build intelligence.** This means to establish
the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make
decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that
implements these principles.

The second is to **advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems**.
This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we
can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve
problems in the future.

To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation
that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative
organization that puts human values first.

#### **About the Role**

Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of
the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.

We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing
concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do
rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make
mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.

Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external
partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems
larger than ones they can tackle alone.

**We expect you to:**

  * Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.

**In addition, the following would be an advantage:**

  * PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.

  * Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.

#### **Responsibilities**

  * Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

  * In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems

  * Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories

  * Develop and maintain open-source software

  * (Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences

  * Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis

### **Role Details**

Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are
still encouraged to apply.

  * **FT/PT:** This is a full-time position
  * **Hours:** While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
  * **Location:** This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

450,"Data Scientist, Creators",Notion,"### **About Us:**

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to
be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any
challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't
build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to
change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar,
Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with
us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are
the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse
and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come
to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that
employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third
day).

### **About The Role:**

Notion's mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our
business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block.
The Growth Data Science team aims at accelerating product growth at every step
of the user journey to ensure you get the best value out of Notion. This role
will work closely with the Template and Creator Community team to accelerate
template creator growth and user adoption of templates by improving Notion
template gallery.

As an early member of the growth data science team, you'll be instrumental in
setting the roadmap for how these teams work together and then doing the
hands-on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from
one day to the next, but whether you're exploring where we see the biggest
opportunity to improve user experience, what a successful Notion account looks
like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to
evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the

That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase,

then expanded into banking which made it remarkably easy for people to
automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money
management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $43 billion of our

an internal business consultant to help optimize every facet of this
organization. You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for
other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better
organization for our 17 million members.  
  
What You’ll Do  
  
Will understand how the specific task fits into the bigger picture and suggest
how to best accomplish within the project framework.  
  
Will self-manage tasks and projects and complete them on time and under
general supervision.  
  
Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by
stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need
to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to
that scenario. You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and
interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or
trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the
data, you will use Tableau.  
  
Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will
present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply
acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into
something else.  
  
This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Costa Mesa,
California, office for regular collaboration days.  
  
What You’ll Need  
  
To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and
data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data,
analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and
delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach?
What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue?
Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your
involvement and decisions at each stage.  
  
For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To
curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python,
R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must
be proficient in either Python or R.  
  
Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very
often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or
we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works
better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or
the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than
expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating
that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than
you.

523,Senior Data Scientist,SentiLink,"SentiLink provides innovative identity and risk solutions, empowering
institutions and individuals to transact confidently with one another.

By building the future of identity verification in the United States and
reinventing the currently clunky, ineffective, and expensive process, we
believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.

We’ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our
real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities,
beginning with financial services. In 2021, we raised a $70M Series B round,
led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products. We’ve
earned coverage and awards from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business
Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and have recently landed on the
Forbes Fintech 50, 2023. Last but not least, we’ve even been a part of
history-we were the first company to go live with the eCBSV and testified
before the United States House of Representatives.

### **Role:**

As a Senior Data Scientist at SentiLink, you will build our core products:
models that identify fraudsters and also advance our growing suite of products
in financial risk. As an experienced researcher you will be relied upon to be
technically capable and the definitive owner of your respective domain. You
will often work on projects with high visibility and impact that require deep
domain understanding, critical thinking and strong technical abilities. You
will work with teams across the company to research new types of fraud,
develop new products, and provide analysis to drive sales and marketing. This
is a full-stack data science role, involving model development, analysis, and
writing production code. You should be interested in having end-to-end
ownership and a fast-moving environment where deep domain understanding drives
development and unusual insights drive our competitive advantage rather than
optimization of new machine learning methodologies.

Technologies: Python 3, PostgreSQL, and AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, RDS,
Redshift, etc.)

This is a remote, US-based role.

### **Responsibilities:**

  * Develop and maintain SentiLink’s fraud detection models through the full model development lifespan: from data acquisition decisions through featurization, focusing labeling resources, model training, experimentation, productionalization, and monitoring.
  * Research new types of fraud and develop new SentiLink products around identity verification.
  * Build foundational modeling to drive SentiLink’s expanding suite of Fraud and Financial Risk products.
  * Achieve success by researching / developing through iteration, integration of new data sources and inventive feature engineering.
  * Write production-ready code that can be relied on for real-time decision making by our partners.
  * Design, perform, and present analyses that will inform data acquisition, product development, risk operations priorities, marketing, and sales efforts.
  * Work with engineering, risk operations, and data acquisitions to access necessary data, maintain data quality, and support data access.

### **Requirements:**

  * 4+ years relevant work experience & relevant PhD or 6+ years & relevant Masters.
  * Proven track record of solving complex / high profile business problems with DS / ML solutions.
  * Experience in communicating outcomes / progress to senior management / stakeholders.
  * Very strong in “end to end” DS development: Planning, fleshing out success criteria / metrics, getting buy-in, developing the solution, delivering the solution (prod / deck / strategy doc / etc)
  * Strong practical ML / Stats knowledge, i.e. can easily employ the suite of standard ML / stats tools to quickly scope out solutions, and double down where needed. Experience with SOTA ML solutions is a plus
  * Interest in developing deep domain expertise for product-focused work: a background in fraud is not required, but willingness to learn is
  * Experience writing production code and tests

  * \- someone we can rely on to make business-changing decisions
  * Bonus for familiarity with: identity solutions, fintech, or adjacent industries
  * Candidates must be legally authorized to work in the United States and must live in the United States
  * Thrive in a fast paced environment characterized by the need to solve extremely varied, high impact, open ended problems.

At Stitch Fix, our data science team combines machine learning with expert
human judgment to generate innovative recommendations and insights that
transform the way our clients discover what they love. We believe in a
curiosity-driven, data science culture where members have autonomy to deliver
impact through end-to-end, full-stack product development and ownership. The
diversity of the problems that we work on and the data-rich environment of our
business make it possible, even essential, to bring the tools of multiple
disciplines to bear on our hardest problems. We are looking for data
scientists and leaders to join us as we revolutionize retail.

The Global Optimization team is connecting the dots for our clients and
inventory. We seek to ensure that Stitch Fix’s systems are operating at their
global optimum rather than at local optima. The team owns distribution of
inventory among clients so that the outcomes for all clients are
simultaneously considered given inventory constraints. We also own the
optimization engine that will power making several critical decisions based on
client demand, for example merchandise buying and allocation. We partner with
Product Managers, Merchandise Planners & Buyers as well as other Algorithm
teams to build central tools that cut across organizational and functional
boundaries of the company.

ABOUT THE ROLE

As a Staff Machine Learning Data Scientist in the Global Optimization team,
you will design, implement and validate improvements to both inventory
distribution and optimization engine based on client demand to scale the
impact to broader Stitch Fix. You will be responsible for maintaining
production systems that power various use cases, and follow strong engineering
principles to keep the maintenance low on the team.

This team has considerable opportunity for impact, by enabling all merchandise
buying decisions based on client demand and fundamentally changing the way we
evaluate inventory health across the company.

production ready code, and running A/B tests.

improve our ability to best serve our clients through efficient use of our
resources.

constraints or reframing perspectives to find possibilities

Have a holistic view on the business by supporting capabilities and projects
that span a wide array of business functions and stakeholders

Operate as a full stack data scientist participating in every stage of
development from idea, analysis, proof of principle to putting into production
with strong engineering practices

Leverage the client-product matching information provided by the inventory
targeting algorithm to enhance cross-team visibility into product and client
performance to improve all stages of the client and merchandise lifecycles.

WE’RE EXCITED ABOUT YOU BECAUSE…

Are an expert in data science, e.g. not just fitting a model but being held
accountable for creating business value.

Have extensive experience developing and maintaining applications to drive
business decisions in production systems.

Have an ability to frame complex problems and generate strategic options
leveraging the data when it is available or offering creative and pragmatic
alternatives when it is not

Have extensive experience developing and maintaining capabilities and models
in production, leveraging an expertise in python; data warehousing; ETL
management using Airflow/Spark/Presto/Trino/Docker; unit and functional
testing best practices with CI/CD, etc

Have an ability to recognize future needs in our architecture and devise
effective interfaces between algorithmic solutions that are necessary to solve
the existing and future business needs.

You are motivated by challenge and do not shy away from potential failure

You’re happiest as a team player, able to balance time against multiple
systems and work streams that span the team’s charter

With a business model that is aligned with our customers, we create transparent, fair, and simple financial products that put money back in the hands of our members, help them spend wisely, avoid unfair fees and build their credit quickly. If autonomy, ownership, and having meaningful input at the company you work for is important to you, come join our growing team!
Brigit is doing innovative and exciting work, but don’t just take our word for it, our work is being recognized by others:
Built In’s 2023 Best Startups to Work For In New York City
Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies of 2022
Forbes Fintech 50 2022
Business Insider’s Most Promising Consumer Startups 2022
Brigit is looking for fullstack engineers to help us scale our next-generation consumer finance platform to millions of users in the next year. We’ve found tremendous traction helping low income Americans make ends meet; now is the time to scale. We’ve built a mobile/web app on React and React Native with Typescript, and a backend of Java services in Google Cloud. It’s served us well so far, but we need help making it even better.
Our team has two main goals:
1) Feature development supporting numerous external and internal applications. The next generation of our product may look nothing like it does today - and we welcome that! The degree to which we implement new user flows, compute our proprietary algorithms, integrate with 3rd party APIs, store data, and serve traffic will make or break our success.
2) Scalability of our customer-facing applications. Growing from 100k to 10 million users presents unique technical challenges. The efficiency and reliability of both our customer-facing and internal tools needs to improve. We have fun Data Engineering tasks, automation procedures, and availability/monitoring problems to tackle. We also have many user-facing projects, including the creation and upkeep of components and libraries, REST API design, testing and QA processes, and CI/CD enhancements.
Our team is small and nimble; you'll be given an extraordinary amount of autonomy and ownership. More importantly, you have a large say in the direction of the company - both in terms of our technology and our product.
Recent accomplishments of our team are:
Building a Payments API platform that moves millions of dollars on a daily basis
Implementing the advanced mathematical processes behind our proprietary risk algorithm
Normalizing relational database schema to optimize for performance for over 1 million users
End to end User notification (via SMS, Email, Push) capabilities
Building internal tools that enable our Customer Support Specialists to help our customers ASAP
One of our greatest strengths is the speed at which we move. If you want to propose a new way of doing things, we are all ears. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'll be open to it. A new design paradigm? Bring it on. At Brigit you can enjoy a mature CI/CD platform with automated deployment processes, an easy-to-use local/staging/production development environment, and teammates willing to fill in the gaps. We automate manual things so we can focus on thinking and building something that helps people.
As a fullstack engineer we’re looking for someone with experience owning a feature from start to finish on both the frontend and backend. We don’t expect everyone to know everything in our stack, but having one side of overlap (frontend/backend) that you feel very comfortable with will set you up for success here.
What You Have
3+ years of industry experience as a software engineer
REST based services and API development experience mainly using Java
Experience building UI/UX for new features from end-to-end using React or React Native
GraphQL experience a plus
Up-to-date grasp of the constantly evolving JS language standards, ES6 and beyond (we use Typescript)
Experience with SQL databases, constructing schemas, performing migrations and writing analytical queries

What You'll Be Doing
Evolving the APIs supporting User flows to ensure a great user experience
Optimizing queries and relational database schema to ensure speedy response times
Implementing algorithms related to monetary transaction evaluation, risk management, income verification, and other predictive models
Integrating with new 3rd party APIs to serve millions of customers
Decreasing our customer service workload by building improvements to the product or improving our internal automations
Implementing interaction and motion design for more delightful user experiences
Automating visual testing & visual regression detection processes
Creating new mobile & web clients for upcoming products
A/B testing and optimizing features that boost our business’ bottom line
The anticipated annual base salary for this position is $100,000 - $170,000. This range does not include any other compensation components or other benefits for which an individual may be eligible. The actual base salary offered depends on a variety of factors, which may include as applicable, the qualifications of the individual applicant for the position, years of relevant experience, specific and unique skills, level of education attained, certifications or other professional licenses held, and the location in which the applicant lives and/or from which they will be performing the job.

What’s the opportunity?
We are searching for Full Stack Software Developer to join our team. You enjoy being surrounded by talented engineers to learn and challenge each other.
You believe developers should be involved much earlier in the process than when it's time to code (although that is pretty fun).

You strive to build beautiful, usable software, and if you aren't the type to wear your beret hat you are encouraged to work with the product designer who is a full-time resource for your team.
We use our own flavor of agile processes to get things done. We use Git and an automated CI setup for builds and Octopus for shipping code to testing environments and to production. We review each other’s pull requests. We believe in automation over repetition and aim to make our code and infrastructure more scalable.
You Will:
Act as part of a cross-functional team, working with developers, designers, Quality Engineers and product owners to bring prototypes to production.
Support our software by fixing bugs, improving performance, and contributing to documentation.
Write awesome code, be you, revel in work.
Perform other duties/projects as assigned.

You Have:
You have experience with object-oriented programming, SQL databases, and web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, etc.)

We're not interested in a checklist of experiences, but here is a list of things we use: .NET, C#, Flutter, Dart, SQL Server, Redis, Hangfire, Azure, IdentityServer, Sass, and probably a few more things.
You are skilled at communication and developing documentation.
You can use independent judgment and discretion requiring minimum supervision.
You have high attention to detail and organization.
You enjoy troubleshooting and helping others.

754,Data Engineer,Nextdata Technologies Inc,"The company

Decentralized data is the future. Data mesh is the right idea. We’re here to make it a reality. Nextdata OS is a data-mesh-native platform built to meet the challenge of decentralizing data at scale. We are inventing a new way for developers to work with data and share it responsibly via data product containers.

Our vision is to build a world where AI/ML and analytics are powered by decentralized, responsible, and equitable data ownership, across boundaries of organizations, technology, and most importantly boundaries of trust.

Our purpose is to change the experience of creating, sharing, discovering, and using data forever, to be connected, fast, and fair based on data mesh principles.

Our technology is designed to empower data developers, users and owners with a delightful experience where data products are a first-class primitive, with trust built-in.

We are here to accept the reality that the world of data is complex and messy; data models are out-of-date the moment they are created; data is owned across trust boundaries; data is stored on different platforms; data is used in many different modes and most importantly data can't protect itself. We are here to recognize that past approaches to tackle these complexities with centralized data collection, modeling and governance are ineffective at best and pathologically unfair at worst. We are here to reimagine, with you!

The role

You will be one of the first data product developers building data products on top of the Nextdata OS. You will work with Nextdata’s initial customers to translate their business needs into PoC data products that you will then build on top of our OS.
You will leverage your experience of the full lifecycle of analytics - translating business requirements to data models, to data pipelines, to analytics dashboards and even machine learning pipelines - to build data products and then provide feedback that will help us improve the Nextdata OS and tooling.

You will manage the full lifecycle of the PoC data products from ideation around business use case to successful deployment, including synthesizing realistic data for testing before deploying into production.

Our expectations

You have worked on complex data pipelines in large data organizations. You have dealt with the uncertainty of iterating from at times an under defined business use case to a concrete end-to-end analytics pipeline that drives value to the business. You may have had to help the business quantify the value of your analyses as well!
You are proficient in the modern data stack tools like airflow, dagster, prefect, dbt and ML development environments like PySpark and Pandas.
You are articulate and are able to present your findings in a compelling manner.
You have relied on continuous integration and continuous deployment to reduce software lead time, and have contributed to optimizing build and release processes as needed.
You have shown evidence that you aspire to test-first data pipeline development!

Our benefits

We are an early stage company, but we don't subsist on ramen! We are an experienced team with families. We provide $6000 for your home workspace setup, premium health, vision, dental insurance coverage for you and your family. And of course, early stage equity and market rate salary.",glassdoor.com,"San Francisco, CA",$102K,$151K

782,Data Scientist III,Automobile Club of Southern California2.8 ★,"As our Data Scientist , you will handle multiple projects at once and act as an internal business consultant to help optimize every facet of this organization. You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better organization for our 17 million members.

What You’ll Do

Will understand how the specific task fits into the bigger picture and suggest how to best accomplish within the project framework.

Will self-manage tasks and projects and complete them on time and under general supervision.

Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to that scenario. You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the data, you will use Tableau.

Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into something else.

This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Costa Mesa, California, office for regular collaboration days.

What You’ll Need

To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data, analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach? What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue? Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your involvement and decisions at each stage.

For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python, R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must be proficient in either Python or R.

Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than you.

OPCS Context
The Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) of the World Bank plays a pivotal role in achieving the World Bank Group’s (WBG) mission. OPCS is at the center of the ‘operations complex’ and plays a critical role in supporting the Bank’s leadership on all issues related to Bank operations. OPCS develops and oversees operational policies and procedures for country engagement products, lending operations, advisory services and analytical support, financial management, procurement, environmental and social safeguards, as well as development outcome risk and results reporting. It also serves as a link between the operational units and the Board of Directors. OPCS provides advice and support to Bank management and staff as well as hands-on assistance to help teams apply the Bank’s policies, processes, and risk management tools for our country clients.
